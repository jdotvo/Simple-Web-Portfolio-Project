        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jesse Vo and I am from Garden Grove, California. I am currently a student enrolled in Thinkful's software engineer program. My goal for the program is to obtain the skills necessary to become a full fledged software engineer that can help clients and companies improve their businesses. Please contact me if you need any additional information!</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Coming from a background in healthcare, I have developed skills that I believe will translate well into a career in web development, such as:</p>

        <!--Used <ul> to list skills in no particular order-->
        <ul>
          <li>Working well and staying calm under stressful situations</li>
          <li>Communicating well with others to efficiently work as a team</li>
          <li>Analyzing people's problems and coming up with an appropriate solution</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>My passion for helping others led me to pursue the career path of a software engineer. Although helping clients/companies will be drastically different, I will still find enjoyment in solving people's problems. Outside of web development, I enjoy participating in physical activities, such as going to the gym and playing basketball. </p>
